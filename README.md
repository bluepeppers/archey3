Archey 3
========

Archey 3 is a system infomation printer, designed to be used when taking screenshots of computer desktops to provide additional infomation about the operating system setup. Archey is designed to be used for Arch linux, and it acordingly prints out the Arch linux logo along side the system infomation.

This is a fork of the original Archey 3 from [lclarkmichalek](https://github.com/lclarkmichalek/archey3).
I try to introduce here some features which i find useful for myself.
